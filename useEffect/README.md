### what is useEffect ?  why we need useEffect ?  

useEffect is a React hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. A side effect is any action that affects the outside world, such as fetching data from an API, updating the DOM, or setting up event listeners.

The useEffect hook takes two arguments: a function that performs the side effect, and an optional array of dependencies that determines when the effect should be executed.



## There are several reasons why we need useEffect:

### Managing side effects: 
useEffect allows you to manage side effects in your component, such as fetching data from an API, setting up event listeners, or updating the DOM. By encapsulating these effects in the useEffect hook, you can ensure that they are executed at the appropriate times and in the correct order.

### Separation of concerns: 
useEffect allows you to separate the logic of your component from the side effects it produces. This makes your code easier to understand and maintain, and can reduce the likelihood of bugs or unintended behavior.

### Performance optimization: 
useEffect can be used to optimize the performance of your component by avoiding unnecessary side effects. By specifying the appropriate dependencies, you can ensure that the effect is only executed when the relevant state or props change.

In summary, useEffect is a powerful tool for managing side effects in your functional components. It allows you to separate concerns, manage complex side effects, and optimize the performance of your component.




### advantage and disadvantages of useEffect


The useEffect hook in React is a powerful tool for managing side effects in functional components. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using useEffect:

## Advantages:

Flexible: The useEffect hook is very flexible and can be used to handle a wide variety of side effects, such as fetching data, subscribing to events, and updating the DOM.

Easy to use: The useEffect hook is easy to use and doesn't require any complex setup or configuration.

Declarative: By using the useEffect hook, you can declare the side effects you want to manage right alongside the state you are managing, making it easier to reason about the behavior of your component.

Avoids race conditions: The useEffect hook is designed to manage side effects in a way that avoids race conditions and other common pitfalls that can occur when managing side effects in class components.

## Disadvantages:

Can be hard to reason about: If used improperly, the useEffect hook can make it harder to reason about the behavior of your component, especially if you have complex side effects that depend on each other.

Can cause performance issues: If you have side effects that are expensive to run or that update the DOM frequently, using the useEffect hook can cause performance issues and slow down your application.

Requires cleanup logic: In some cases, you may need to provide cleanup logic to useEffect to ensure that your side effects don't leak memory or resources.

Can be overused: It's important to use the useEffect hook judiciously and only for side effects that truly require it. Overusing useEffect can make your code harder to read and reason about, and can also cause performance issues.
